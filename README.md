## Introduction
Mixture of Experts (MoE) is a machine learning technique that combines specialized sub-models ("experts") to solve complex tasks efficiently. This implementation focuses on **sparse gating** and **Switch Transformers**, where inputs are routed to a single expert (or a subset) to balance performance and computational cost. Key advantages include:
- **Scalability**: Add/remove experts without retraining the entire model.
- **Efficiency**: Sparse activation reduces computational overhead.
- **Flexibility**: Modular design for experimentation with routing strategies.

## Requirements
- **Python**: 3.7+
- **PyTorch**: ≥1.7.0
- **Torchvision**: ≥0.8.0

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```

---

## Model Architecture
The model integrates the following components:
1. **Token and Position Embedding Layer**: Combines token embeddings with positional information.
2. **Switch Layer**: A sparse MoE layer where a gating network routes inputs to experts (feed-forward networks).
3. **Transformer Block**: Includes self-attention and the Switch layer for contextual understanding.
4. **Classification Head**: A neural network for downstream tasks (e.g., text classification).

### Key Design Choices:
- **Sparse Gating**: Only a subset of experts is activated per input (e.g., top-1 or top-2 routing).
- **Dynamic Routing**: A learned gating mechanism assigns inputs to the most relevant experts.
- **Efficient Scaling**: Switch Transformers reduce complexity by routing to a single expert per input.

## Usage
### Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/moe-switch-transformers.git
cd moe-switch-transformers
```
### Run the Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook MOE.ipynb
```
### Adjust Hyperparameters:

Number of experts

Expert hidden dimensions

Training epochs and batch size

Routing strategies (e.g., top_k experts)

---

## Example
Train the model on a text classification task:
```python
from model import Model

# Define parameters
num_experts = 8
embed_dim = 64
ff_dim = 64
vocab_size = 20000
dropout_rate = 0.1

# Initialize model
model = Model(
    num_experts=num_experts,
    embed_dim=embed_dim,
    ff_dim=ff_dim,
    vocab_size=vocab_size,
    dropout_rate=dropout_rate
)

# Training loop (see train.py for full implementation)
```

---

## Key Features
- **Modular Design**: Experts and gating networks are decoupled for easy customization.
- **Scalability**: Add experts incrementally to improve performance without full retraining.
- **Sparse Activation**: Reduces memory and compute requirements compared to dense models.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Supports top-k expert selection (e.g., `top_k=1` for Switch Transformers).
